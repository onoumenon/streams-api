## JSON server

A simple JSON API server for a [Twitch clone](https://github.com/onoumenon/streams).

To start the server, run `npm start`.

To set up the entire project, you will also need a client (eg: React UI), OBS (to start a livestream) as well as a RTMP server.

Please visit [my blogpost](https://stuffihavelearnt.home.blog/2019/06/20/creating-a-simple-twitch-clone/) for set up instructions.
